Hello.

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Political Economy and Government (Government Track) from Harvard University. My fields of study are political economy, development and comparative politics. Previously I worked in Mexico's federal government at the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. 

I am on the non-academic job market in 2023-2024.
