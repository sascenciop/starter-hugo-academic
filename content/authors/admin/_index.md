Hello.

I am an economist and political scientist currently pursuing a PhD in Political Economy and Government at Harvard University. My PhD program was designed as collaborative program between the Harvard Kennedy School, the Department of Economics, and the Department of Government, with the objective of fostering research at the intersection of Economics and Political Science. My fields of study are political economy, economic development, comparative politics and public finance. I conduct research on a variety of topics at the intersection of political economy, public finance and development, and I use observational and experimental methods to estimate causal effects.

Before my doctoral studies, I worked as an economist and policy-maker in Mexico's federal Ministry of Finance and Public Credit from 2014 to 2018. 

I am on the non-academic job market in 2023-2024.
